Q. 5. Write a Python program that generates a password using a random combination of words from a dictionary file.
import random

with open('dictionary.txt', 'r') as file:
    items = file.read().splitlines()

words = [item for item in items if item.isalpha()]
numbers = [item for item in items if item.isdigit()]
special_chars = [item for item in items if not item.isalnum()]

def generate_password(password_length):
    password = ''

    password += random.choice(words).capitalize()
    password += random.choice(words).lower()
    password += random.choice(numbers)
    password += random.choice(special_chars)

    while len(password) < password_length:
        word = random.choice(words)
        number = random.choice(numbers)
        special_char = random.choice(special_chars)

        password += word + number + special_char
        if len(password) > password_length:
            excess_length = len(password) - password_length
            password = password[:-excess_length]

    return password

def menu():
    while True:
        print("\nMenu:")
        print("1. Generate a password")
        print("2. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2): ")

        if choice == '1':
            while True:
                try:
                    password_length = int(input("Enter the desired password length (8-12): "))
                    if 8 <= password_length <= 12:
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Please enter a number between 8 and 12.")
                except ValueError:
                    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 8 and 12.")

            password = generate_password(password_length)
            print(f"Generated Password: {password}")

            another = input("Would you like to generate another password? (yes/no): ").lower()
            if another != 'yes':
                break

        elif choice == '2':
            print("Exiting...")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    menu()





EXPLANATION
WHY USE A WORD-BASED PASSWORD?
•	SECURE AND MEMORABLE: Word-based passwords are longer, making them harder to crack through brute force. They’re also easier for humans to remember compared to random strings of characters.

•	RANDOMNESS: The randomness in word selection enhances security, as it prevents predictability.

CUSTOMIZING THE PASSWORD
•	You can:

o	Increase the number of words to make the password more secure.

o	Use different separators

o	Add random capitalization or numbers for added complexity.
________________________________________SECURITY TIP
Ensure the dictionary file has a sufficient number of unique words to make the password hard to guess. A small dictionary significantly reduces security.
